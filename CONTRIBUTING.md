# Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

# Missing a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please consider the size of the change in order to determine the right steps to proceed:

For a *Major Feature*, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

Note: Significantly re-writing a topic, counts as a major feature.

*Small Features* can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.

# Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs, we require that you provide a minimal reproduction. Having a minimal reproducible scenario gives us a wealth of important information without going back and forth to you with additional questions.

A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

We require a minimal reproduction to save maintainers' time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Often, developers find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal reproduction.

# Coding Rules

This repository makes use of eslint and the next-styling for it. Furthermore we use [Angular commit conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit) for git commits.
