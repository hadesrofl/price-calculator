# Cost and Pricing

What kind of terms do we have regarding the cost of a product and its price?
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Costs

* **Fixed Costs:** Costs that are not tied to producing a single unit of the product. 
  * Examples: General manufacturing cost (e.g. paying for the design of the product) or something totally unrelated like salaries, rent for offices etc.
* **Variable Costs:** Costs that are tied to manufacturing this specific product. Those costs can be calculated per produced piece.
  * Examples: Material costs, energy cost, shipping, packaging
* **Discount:** The amount that is reduced from the price for distributors or for other reasons (paying the bill early etc.)

## Pricing

* **Sales Volume:** Amount of sold units of the product.
* **Price per Unit:** The price we charge before applying discounts.
